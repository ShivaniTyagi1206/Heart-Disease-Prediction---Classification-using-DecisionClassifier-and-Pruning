# Heart Disease Prediction - Classification

## Objective:

   Classify person whether he has Heart Dieases or does not have Heart Disease.

## Data:
    https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.cleveland.data

## Data Set Information:

This database contains 14 attributes, The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. 

## Metadata:

-  **age**,       Age of the Person
-  **sex**,       Gender (Category)

                    - 0 = Female

                    - 1 = typical angina

                    - 2 = atypical anigna

                    - 3 = non-anigna pain

                    - 4 = asymptomatic

-  **chol**,      cholestrol
-  **fbs**,       fasting blood suger (Category)

                    - 0 => 120mg/dl

                    - 1 =< 120mg/dl

-  **restecg**,   resting electrocardiographic results (Category)

                    - 1 = normal

                    - 2 = having ST-T wave abnormality

                    - 3 = Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy

-  **thalach**,   Maximum heart rate achieved 
-  **exang**,     excercise induced angina (Category)

                    - 0 = no

                    - 1 = yes

-  **oldpeak**,   ST Depression induced by excercise relative to rest
-  **slope**,     The slope of the peak excercise ST Segment (Category)

                    - 1 = unsloping

                    - 2 = flat

                    - 3 = downsloping

                    - 3 = normal

                    - 6 = fixed defect

                    - 7 = reversible defect

-  **HD**,       The predicted attribute

                    - 0 = for no heart deisease
                    
                    - 1 to 4 = for severity of heard deisease
